On developing apps or products, we may have different versions of that product. If the new version is
updated then, the previous version coded should also be maintained. So, such maintaining  of versions is
carried by version control system. There are different version control systems like git , mercurial, perforce etc

Need of Version Control System
=> To maintain product versions.
=> For team collaboration in a project.



The codes of project should be stored somewhere in the cloud. Google Drive or any other cloud storage
services can be used for  storing code, but they don't provide git support and there will be more manual
work for team collaboration. So, we use cloud services which understands git instead of Google Drive.
The example of such cloud services which understands git are, GitHub, GitLab,BitBucket etc.
