=>while working on a professional project we do not merge code with other branches to
 the main branch in local.
=>The codes in the main branch should always go through the review process known as Pull Request.
=>Pull Request is opened in the github. It can be opened by selecting two branches; one branch is the
  feature branch and another is the main branch.
