# There may be different projects in your system with different requirement of packages
# your one project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas  other project may require pandas version 2.4
# So to  solve this problem we can use the concept  of virtual environment

# Virtual environment is a separate  environment in your system where we can install packages
# in isolated form for each project.

# Important Commands
1. python -m venv <name_of_the_environment(venv)>
           = creates a new virtual environment
2. venv\Scripts\activated (for windows devices in command prompt)
   source venv/bin/activate ( for mac devices)
           =>activates the virtual environment
3. deactivate
       => it  deactivates the virtual environment
4. pip install <package_name>
      => if installs the package to the environment
5. pip freeze
     => it creates a file "requirements.txt" consisting  of  all the installed packages in the environment
6. pip  freeze > requirements.txt
     => it created a files consisting  of all packages
7. pip install -r requirements.txt
     => recursively installs all the packages from requirements.txt file
