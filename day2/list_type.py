# Python lists are mutable objects
# We  can create  a list by enclosing  a sequence  in big
# brackets[]

# We can also create a list using list () built-in function

a = [] # An empty list
b = list () # An empty list using list () function

a = [1,2,3] # Non-empty list
# In this list , all data are of integer data type. But list can also
# Have heterogenous type

a = [1,"hello",2.1,{1,,2,3 } ,{"a": 1 ,"b":2}]
#In this list , the data are of different types which is also supported
# in python list.
# We can use built-in type()  function to check the type of an object
type([1,2,3]) #list
type ([1,2,3]) # tuple
type(1) #int
# and so on..
