 # Indentation in python is very important.
 # An indentation/ tab is equivalent to 4 spaces.
 # We do not use curly  braces in python to determine
 # a block of code. Instead , we  use indentation.

 #Following is an example of a C code
 #if (a==2){
 #    printf("hello world")
 # }
 #here the block of if condition is determined using
 #curly  braces

  #But in python  block is determined by indentation
  #For example
   a = 2
    if  a = 2:
        print ("Hello World")
        b = 2
        if b ==2:
            print ("Python")
            print ("Is")
            print ("Awesome")
         print ("")
